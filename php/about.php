Nagin, an ACCA member since 1990 has worked both in practice and as an educationist throughout his working life. Both ACCA and teaching have been close to his heart and so it was very easy for him to create awareness of the ACCA qualification in different parts of the world. From chairing the Leicestershire District Society of Association of Accounting Technicians to lecturing the Ministry of Finance in Havana, Nagin has undertaken various roles and responsibilities with government and semi-government entities. In 2001 Nagin joined De Montfort University in Leicester on a full-time basis as a senior lecturer and ACCA course director. Most recently, Nagin was also a member of ACCA exam review board for three and a half years from 2004-2007 and was external examiner at Brighton University for skills level papers until December 2012 and is currently chief external examiner at University of Wales Newport for the ACCA programme. Nagin has taught ACCA papers in Jamaica and Trinidad for over ten years as well as conducting CPD events in Trinidad, Barbados and Bermuda and Belize.</p>
